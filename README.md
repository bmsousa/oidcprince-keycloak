Each directory have a README file with some informations and configurations about respective components.

To test our implementation, just follow the steps below.

## 1º [`oidc-risk-module-main`](./oidc-risk-module-main) and [`oidc-keycloak-theme-testversion`](./oidc-keycloak-theme-testversion)

### 1.1 Running the Complete System (Keycloak with Risk Module)

- `git clone <oidc-risk-module-main>`
- `git clone <oidc-keycloak-theme-testversion>`
- `cd oidc-risk-module-main`
- Start the services with `docker-compose up --build`

<ins>**Verification:**</ins>

- Open http://127.0.0.1:5001 in your browser to test the API, or test with Keycloak.
- Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 to access the Keycloak admin interface.

Note: if it is the first time you are setting up keycloak you may encounter the error: 

*Local access required*
*You will need local access to create the temporary administrative user.*
*To create the temporary administrative user open http://localhost:8080/, or use a bootstrap-admin command.*


Thus you need to change the Docker file to include the bootstrap variables to init the  master realm with admin user.

- Log in using admin credentials (default: username `admin`, password `admin`).
- Check the [`README`](./oidc-keycloak-theme-testversion#readme) to see more information about the screens.
- To stop and remove the volumes and the containers (optional): `docker-compose down -v`

## 2º [`Flask-Client-Application`](./Flask-Client-Application)

- `git clone <Flask-Client-Application>`
- `cd Flask-Client-Application` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary requirements, and run `python FlaskClient.py` to up the test application

<ins>**Verification:**</ins>

- Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
- Follow the [`README`](./Flask-Client-Application#readme) for detailed context and login images.
- If a dependency installation error appears, install the missing dependency manually.

## Notes for Production Deployment

For deploying to production, consider the following adjustments:

Each project has a Dockerfile and a docker-compose to run the projects individually.

1. **Environment Variables:** Use a `.env` file for managing environment-specific settings, such as database passwords or API URLs.
2. **Security:** Replace default passwords, and ensure sensitive information is secured.
3. **Production Optimizations:** Remove unnecessary development dependencies, improve logging, and configure your services for performance in production.
